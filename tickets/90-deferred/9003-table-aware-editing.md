# Ticket: 9003 (Deferred) Table-Aware Editing Tools

Deferred by design.

## Why
Human operators frequently "append row to table" and "update row by key" while preserving table semantics.

## Scope (Future)
- `append_table_rows`
- `update_table_rows_by_key`
- preserve table style and structured refs
