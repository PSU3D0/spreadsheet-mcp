# Ticket: 9004 (Deferred) Print/Layout Feature Parity

Deferred by design.

## Why
Board-ready exports often require:
- print titles (repeat rows/cols)
- headers/footers beyond odd
- gridlines/headings print flags

## Scope (Future)
- Extend umya page setup and header/footer models.
- Add MCP ops to `sheet_layout_batch`.
